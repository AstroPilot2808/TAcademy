Implimentation Plans for TAcademy
As stated from our previous plans created, here is a detailed list of all things that must be implemented to the site
1. Home Page: home page is obviously the first page that every person likely visits so it requires the "inspiration" and "pull" to attract more students
    - Donation Button: Either have the button open a new page with the payment portal. You can attach my venmo: @tanishqb27. Zelle: 412-919-7673. I'll make sure that the money that is received(if any) will be distrubuted evenly upon us and utilized only on this website, until we have nearly perfected the site. 
    - Welcome to Tacademy button at the top/ banner/ logo: when clicked, return back to home page.
    - Courses: This should just be a dropdown of all courses the user is registered in. If not registered in any than a link should be attached to show all courses and the user is able to pick the classes they want to prioritize.  
    - Purpose: Just 1 statement from Ajay and TQ about what our purpose is for the future of TAcademy
    - Games section: This should just show an image of each game that the students could play and just a tiny description about each one. The person with the highest score on the leaderboard should also be written in the description. Make sure to add a more coming soon to it. For now just add one game description and image of car racing. 
    -Settings Link in the navbar: Account changes for email, number, etc. Display Rank in all games and rank in leaderboard overall. This should also include an additional button to display the overall global leaderboard. Display the banner type achieved after answered certain questions. For example after a user has correctly answered 20 different questions: the banner is upgraded to turtle. 50 - Panda and then on and on.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
